-What did you hope to learn but did not?
I think maybe Scott could spend more time explaining some fundamental things like the usage of map and filter to us. 

-What did you really enjoy in this course, and how?
Try to solve problem with help of TA and Scott in homework and in class exercises.

-What worked well in this course? and how?
All the in class exercises are closely related to the homework and are really useful. And the material of this class is very up-to-date.

-What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
I think the comments of surveys are not very useful and I do not know somehow I only get one result.

-Anything else you like to say?
Yes the workload is so much heavy and push me to stay up all night for some homework. And maybe the late policy could give us some late days in the future. But this kind of class really pushes me to improve myself. So thanks anyway.
